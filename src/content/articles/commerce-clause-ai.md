# The Commerce Clause in the Age of AI: Guardrails and Opportunities for State Legislatures

**Author:** Matt Perault and Jai Ramaswamy

## Executive Summary

As artificial intelligence continues to reshape commerce and society, state legislatures face unprecedented challenges in regulating AI technologies while respecting constitutional boundaries. The Commerce Clause, which grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, presents both opportunities and constraints for state-level AI governance.

## Key Constitutional Considerations

The Commerce Clause analysis for AI regulation involves several critical factors:

- **Interstate Impact:** AI systems often operate across state lines, triggering federal jurisdiction
- **Economic Effects:** State AI regulations can significantly impact national commerce
- **Technology Neutrality:** Regulations must avoid discriminating against out-of-state AI providers

## State Legislative Opportunities

Despite constitutional constraints, states can effectively regulate AI in several areas:

### 1. Consumer Protection

States can implement robust consumer protection measures for AI applications, including:

- Transparency requirements for AI decision-making
- Right to explanation for automated decisions
- Protection against algorithmic discrimination

### 2. Data Privacy

States can establish comprehensive data protection frameworks that complement federal efforts while respecting interstate commerce principles.

### 3. Public Sector AI

States have broad authority to regulate AI use within their own government operations and procurement processes.

## Recommended Approach

State legislatures should adopt a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that:

- Engages with federal agencies and other states
- Focuses on high-impact, constitutionally sound regulations
- Prioritizes consumer protection and ethical AI use
- Maintains flexibility for technological innovation

## Conclusion

While the Commerce Clause presents challenges, state legislatures can play a crucial role in AI governance by focusing on areas within their constitutional authority and working collaboratively with federal partners to create a comprehensive regulatory framework.
