# Generative AI Models
Use algorithms to create new content resembling their training data

## **Generative AI model architectures**

### VAEs
- Encoder: Input data into a latent space representation
- Latent space captures essential data characterstics
- Decoder: Generates data based on this representation

#### GANs:
- Generator: New data samples    
- Disriminator: Verify the generated data

#### Autoregressive Models:
- Create Data sequentially
- Consider the context

#### Transformers:
- Generate text sequences
- Perform cross-language translations effectively

#### Categories:
- Unimodal: Same Modality
- Multimodal: Different Modality

*** Here modality refers that the type of data being processed ***
