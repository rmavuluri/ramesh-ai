# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that finds hidden patterns in data without using labeled examples. Unlike supervised learning, there are no "correct answers" provided during training - the algorithm must discover structure on its own.

## Key Characteristics

- No labeled training data required
- Discovers hidden patterns and structures
- Used for exploratory data analysis
- Can reveal insights not obvious to humans
- Often used as a preprocessing step

## Main Types

### Clustering
Groups similar data points together. Examples include:
- Customer segmentation
- Gene sequencing
- Market research
- Image segmentation

### Dimensionality Reduction
Reduces the number of features while preserving important information. Helps with:
- Visualization
- Computational efficiency
- Noise reduction
- Feature selection

### Association Rules
Finds relationships between different items or events. Commonly used in:
- Market basket analysis
- Recommendation systems
- Cross-selling strategies

## Common Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data into k clusters
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Creates tree-like cluster structures
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality
- **DBSCAN:** Density-based clustering
- **Apriori Algorithm:** Finds frequent item sets
- **Autoencoders:** Neural networks for compression

## Real-World Applications

- Customer segmentation for marketing
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity
- Data compression and visualization
- Market basket analysis
- Gene sequence analysis
- Social network analysis
- Image and video processing

## Advantages

- No need for labeled data
- Can discover unexpected patterns
- Useful for data exploration
- Helps with data preprocessing

## Challenges

- Difficult to evaluate performance
- Results can be subjective
- May not find meaningful patterns
- Requires domain expertise for interpretation

## Best Practices

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize data
2. **Feature Scaling:** Ensure features are on similar scales
3. **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with different parameters
4. **Visualization:** Use plots to understand results
5. **Domain Knowledge:** Apply business context to findings
